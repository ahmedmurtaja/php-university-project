                    <p>At the beginning of 2020, I noticed an increase in the demand in the labor market for the field of mobile software development, so I decided to take a Java course and start developing mobile software, and I finished training on 4/2021 and started tranning in Google company for 3 months and afterthat I started freelancing alone because I had a good experience in this field.</p>

                    <p>After the mobile software development experience, I became a second year university and took front end development (HTML, CSS and Javascript), and I liked the topic, then I improved my skills and I decided to take a back end development course (php) and become a full stack developer , after several months of expereince I decided to make a new experiment and alot of attemps finally , I could to work in Facebook company for 1 year.</p>

                    <p>Machine learning works with huge data sets, so fundamental knowledge of computer science and the underlying architecture is compulsory. Expertise in working with big data analytics, and complex data structures, are a must. Thus, a degree or a formal course in these domains is required for a machine learning career. Your resume must display your skills at working with parallel/distributed architecture, data structure like trees and graphs, and complex computations. These are required to apply or implement, at the time of programming</p>

                    <p>The theories of probability are the mainstays of the most machine learning algorithm. Being familiar with probability enables you to deal with the uncertainty of data. Getting a grasp of the probability theories like Python, Gaussian Mixture Models, and Hidden Markov Models; is a must if you want to be considered for a machine learning job that centres around model building and evaluation.</p>
